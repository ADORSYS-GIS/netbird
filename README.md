# NetBird

NetBird is an open-source VPN solution that allows you to create secure private networks for your teams and infrastructure. It uses WireGuardÂ® to create a secure overlay network, enabling direct, peer-to-peer connections between your devices, regardless of their physical location.

## Key Features

*   **Secure Private Networks**: Build secure, encrypted networks for your devices and services.
*   **Peer-to-Peer Connectivity**: Direct connections between devices, reducing latency and improving performance.
*   **Identity-Based Access Control**: Integrate with your existing Identity Provider (IdP) for user authentication and authorization.
*   **Simple Configuration**: Easy to set up and manage, even for complex network topologies.
*   **Cross-Platform Support**: Clients available for Linux, Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android.

## Deployment Options

NetBird can be deployed in various ways, depending on your needs:

*   **Self-Hosted**: Deploy NetBird on your own infrastructure for complete control.
*   **Cloud-Managed**: Utilize managed NetBird services for simplified operations.

This repository includes an Ansible automation suite for self-hosting NetBird with Caddy as a reverse proxy, providing automated SSL/TLS and simplified service management.
