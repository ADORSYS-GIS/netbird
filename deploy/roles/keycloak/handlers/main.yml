# Keycloak role handlers
# 
# NOTE: Docker-related handlers are in deploy_handlers.yml
#       They are only loaded when keycloak_deploy_mode: true
#       This prevents parsing errors in external mode

# No handlers defined here - external mode doesn't need any
# All configuration changes are applied immediately via Keycloak API
